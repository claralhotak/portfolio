        	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	<div class="half-width">
    		<p>I have used computer my whole life and taught myself to design an code websites when I was 12 years old. I never picture myself doing that as my career, and so I pursued a psychology degree instead. I was always interested in learning more about people, so I thought it was a fitting choice. One Bachelor's Degree, two and a half years in the mental health field, and one crushed dream of graduate school later, I am looking for a change.

    	<div class="half-width">
    		<p>After remembering the enjoyment I used to get out of web development (and remembering I live in the Silicon Valley), I knew what direction to step in. While mental health is abstract and variant, code is concrete, perfectable, and predictable.</p>
