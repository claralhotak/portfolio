					<h2>Introduction</h2>


					<div class="half-width">
						<p>I have used computers my whole life and taught myself to design and code websites when I was 12 years old. I never pictured myself doing that as my career, and so I pursued a psychology degree instead. I was always interested in learning more about people, so I thought it was a fitting choice. One Bachelor's Degree, two and a half years in the mental health field, and one crushed dream of graduate school later, I am looking for a change.</p>
					</div>


					<div class="half-width">
						<p>After remembering the enjoyment I used to get out of web development (and remembering I live in the Silicon Valley), I knew what direction to step in. While mental health is abstract and variant, code is concrete, perfectable, and predictable.</p>

						<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>


						<p>I have been designing and coding websites since I was 12 years old. I can provide quick, clean, and eloquent code for your website.</p>

						<h3>Design & Converting</h3>


						<p>I have also been using various versions of Adobe Photoshop since I was 12 and am extremely familiar in its use. I can turn your vision, in the form of a PSD, into the code to make your ideal website run. I am also able to create a web page from the ground up, from the wireframe stage to logos and finishing touches.</p>

						<h3>Javascript & jQuery</h3>


						<p>I recently learned how to implement Javascript and jQuery to make web pages more interactive and dynamic. While still a beginner, I am willing to learn any necessary skills to further my script abilities.</p>
